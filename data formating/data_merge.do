* Cleaning Compustat and CRSP datasets
* Author: Sai Zhang (saizhang@london.edu)
* This project is prepared for the project of Prof. Stephen Schaefer

* This script merge CRSP data and Compustat data together. 
** CRSP data contains monthly closing prices and return information.
** Compustat data contains quarterly firm balance sheet information.
** for data before 2020, I downloaded data from the data set named CRSP Compustat Merged (CCM)
** for data after 2020, I downloaded data from CRSP and Compustat webpages separately
